# Resarch Simulation 

This Java desktop application allows researchers to simulate the observation and collection of flora/fauna in different habitats. It provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, enabling researchers to conduct simulations easily.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hcmgr/research_sim.git
```

2. Ensure you:
    - have an SDK with JavaFX pre-installed (ie: Zulu 11 from Azul) or are able to install it yourself
    - have JUnit 4 added to your class path
    - are using an SDK compatible with Java 11

3. Include the following in your CLI arguments:

```bash 
saves/{your_scene_file}
```

where:
- 'your_scene_file' is the scene .txt file you wish to load into the simulation (see Scene File Format)

4. Run Launcher.java
